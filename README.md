# Optical-Character-Recognition-Project

I wrote a Python script that uses OpenCV and the open-source Tesseract OCR engine to perform optical character recognition on images. I evaluated tesseract page segmentation modes and advanced image processing to improve the accuracy of the characters and words extracted from the images. I modified the script to automatically locate and obtain the machine-readable zones of images of passports.
